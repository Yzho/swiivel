The goal of swiivel is to build a clone of the "Tanks!" game from "Wii Play" and then enhance it.  It can already accomodate up to 4 wii remotes ("wiimotes"); each controls a different toy tank on the same large screen.  Play can be cooperative or competitive, and can be team-based.

Currently, swiivel uses pygame and a hacked-up version of the WMD wiimote driver by Francois A. Bradet.
